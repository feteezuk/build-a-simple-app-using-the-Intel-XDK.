# build-a-simple-app-using-the-Intel-XDK.

Goals:

1. Add your name and date you created the app 
2. test your app in the Emulate tab and then you will use the Build tab and click on the Build button of the Android found inside the group CORDOVA HYBRID MOBILE APP PLATFORMS.
3. Download Build button to download the .apk file that can be installed in an Android device, OR

Unfortunately, I was not able to upload the file because the apk file created for the Android App was over 25k.

The Intel-XDK was really easy and fun to use.  This platform allows developers to build
hybrid HTML5 apps for mobile phone and table devices for IOS, Android and Windows simply using html5, CSS3 and Javascript.  This app gives developers acess to demos,  blank STANDARD HTML5PROJECT or a blank HTML5 + CORDOVA PROJECt, game demos.  The project directory allows you to create your new project, and store it wherever you like on your computer.

The develop tab includes a Brackets Editor for you to edit your html code base.

Based off this website, https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/hub/blogs/how-to-make-a-mobile-virtual-pet-game-with-html5-and-cordova, the author states

"A normal web app or HTML5 app is purely HTML, CSS and JavaScript and works just fine in any (up to date) web browser.

A hybrid app is a HTML5 app that is “wrapped” as a native app in “webview”. A webview is a native widget that renders HTML/CSS/JavaScript in a native app. Cordova is an Open Source tool that allows us to wrap our HTML5 apps and games in native platforms, and that also provides a bunch of API’s to access native device features (such as the phone camera, accelerometer, file system, notifications, etc) so that we can access these features in our HTML5 apps and games."
